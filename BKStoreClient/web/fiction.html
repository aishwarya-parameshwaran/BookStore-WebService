      <h1>Oath of the Vayuputras</h1>
<p align="justify">
Har, har mahadev! They say Shiva is the easiest god to please, making him one of the most revered among followers.

In walks author Amish Tripathi with his trilogy and turns God into one of us — a simple human being. He chills with his friends sharing a joint, flirts with his wife and loses his temper. He even blushes awkwardly when passersby bow and address him as the Lord
or Mahadev.



For those who have read the previous books, by the time you rip open your online delivery of the book, or rush home from the bookstore to devour the finale paperback, you almost feel like Shiva is a friend. That guy who screams, bursts into laughter, acts on impulse and has an important task at hand — sounds like someone you know?

Shiva’s urban dialect is entertaining as he flirts with Sati on the deck and his companions tells him to ‘find a room’.

In the first book, Shiva, the Tibetan barbarian, is recognised as the Neelkanth — incarnation of the Mahadev. In the land of Meluha, he is the only hope for the Suryavanshi rulers, who are attacked by terrorists from the Chandravanshis, who are helped by the Nagas, an ostracised race of deformed humans.

In the second book, he unravels the mystery of the Nagas, and hunts for the killer of his beloved friend. Leaving many questions unanswered.

Taking off from the second book of the trilogy, Shiva meets his friend Brahaspati in the Naga capital, Panchvati and the Evil is finally revealed. With his target identified, Shiva, the Neelkanth, must wage war against the fiercest of warriors leading the people away from the Good, which has now become the country’s greatest enemy.

The plot reveals all the closed cards on the table, and ties the loose ends of the previous books. Readers may brace themselves for a detailed history class. We recommend that you read the first two books before you plunge into this one. With all the characters of the previous stories having an important part to play in the twists and turns, at times the crowd hinders the otherwise racy pace.

The author’s grip is steady throughout the narrative, feeding only those facts that he wants the readers to lap up, and hazing out evident clues that could have made you guess the mystery. The war has the readers’ undivided attention, giving the Trilogy an end it deserves.
